# foobot
Telegram and Facebook Messenger bot for messing around and general shenanigans

Foobot is always developing, learning, and planning world domination.

### TODO:
- [x] Rename foobot to something more professional. foobot internally, but something like Mortimer externally (bot apis)
- [x] Canada Post package tracking
- [ ] FedEx package tracking
- [ ] UPS package tracking
- [x] Memory by foobot. Get foobot to member things for you
- [x] Facebook messenger support
- [x] Facebook login for single user across all bot types
- [x] Somewhere to hide secrets
- [x] Automated apartment door buzzer control
- [x] URL shortening
- [x] Classic sassiness

### Notes:
Control flow:
```
Index => Routes => Processing => Source-specific Service => Actions => callback all the way to routes
```
